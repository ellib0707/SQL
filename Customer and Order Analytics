#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many total orders were placed in January? 
SELECT count(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of the orders in January were for an iPhone? 
SELECT count(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND product is 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<> 'Order ID';

#4. What was the cheapest sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY product;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than two products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity=6
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
